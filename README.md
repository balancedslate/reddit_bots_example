# Reddit Bots

These are two basic reddit bots that use Python to implement PRAW

These are templates, designed to be copied and changed depending on the intented Target.
One File searches for a specific word within a subreddit, and the other makes a post to a specific subreddit.

You can add rules using Reddits' PRAW functions, and normal conditional statements.
